### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Ismaeel. 

I am a 14 year old living in New York City. I have many hobbies such as programming, engineering, photography, and more. I've been programming for many years and I think I've gotten pretty good at it ðŸ‘€. Over the pandemic, I've spent my time learning many skills. I've been getting into puzzles, electrical and mechanical engineering, and other things. I love hot chocolate (the drink, not the bar) and I play games.

ðŸ¥› Milk is amazing.

ðŸ’» Computers are the future.

ðŸ§  Neuroscience is key.
